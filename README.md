## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View a responsive 404 page that adapts to different screen sizes.
- Understand the error message clearly with a distinct visual that represents the error.
- Navigate back to the homepage via a button.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I reinforced my understanding of the mobile-first workflow and how to effectively use Flexbox to create a responsive layout. Additionally, I deepened my knowledge of using _media queries_ to adapt the design for different screen sizes.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  main {
    flex-direction: row;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    gap: 50px;
  }
```

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks - A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This guide helped me understand how to use Flexbox to center content effectively.
- [MDN Web Docs - Responsive design](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design) - This article provided a comprehensive overview of responsive design principles, which I applied in this project.
